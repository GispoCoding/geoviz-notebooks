		<h2>Analysis process in short</h2>
			<ol>
			  <li>Select the datasets you want to include in the analysis</li>
			  <li>Select the area of interest from the map view</li>
			  <li>If you want to include public transit analysis, add the URL to the relevant GTFS feed</li>
			  <li>Click <strong>import datasets</strong> </li>
			  <li>Wait for the process to finish</li>		
			  <li>View results on the from the map tab</li>

		<h2>Output attributes</h2>	
			
			<p>When you view the result maps, you will see that they include several attributes describing that particular hexagon. Below are short explanations of each attribute.</p>
				<dl>
				<dt><strong>Sum</strong></dt>
				<dd>An index value comprised from all other attributes. The value is normalized for each individual map. This means that e.g. the hexagon containing the highest value of transit departures per day gets an index value of 1 and then other hexagons get a value relative to the highest value. This means that the theoretical maximum value for the sum index is the number of variables (datasources) used.</dd>
				
				<dt><strong>OpenStreetMap amenities</strong></dt>
				<dd>Number of OpenStreetMap amenities inside the hexagon. Describes the level of services.</dd>

				<dt><strong>Flickr photographers</strong></dt>
				<dd>Number of unique Flickr photographers inside the hexagon in the last 5 years.</dd>

				<dt><strong>GTFS departures</strong></dt>
				<dd>Transit departures per day from this hexagon</dd>

				<dt><strong>OpenStreeMap walking times</strong></dt>
				<dd>Walking time from this hexagon in seconds to the fifth closest service.</dd>

				<dt><strong> Ookla Internet device numbers</strong></dt>
				<dd>Number of unique interenet connected devices in this hexagon which have been using the Ookla speedtest.</dd>

				<dt><strong>Kontur population density</strong></dt>
				<dd>How many people are estimated to live inside the hexagon.</dd>

		<h2>Datasets</h2>	
		
			<h4>OpenStreeMap amenities</h4>					
			<p><a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap (OSM)</a> is the main source of services in the analysis.</p>
			<p>Selecting appropriate tags from OpenStreetMap data is one of the most fundamental tasks in the analysis process. The selected tags are based on examples from scientific literature. The tags used currently are listed below:</p>
					<p> <code>    "amenity": [
									"restaurant",
									"bar",
									"pub",
									"biergarten",
									"cafe",
									"food",
									"marketplace",
									"fast_food",
									"food_court",
									"ice_cream",
									"arts_centre",
									"cinema",
									"club",
									"community_centre",
									"library",
									"nightclub",
									"theatre",
									"place_of_worship",
									"public_bath"
									]</code></p>
					<p> <code>"shop": True</code></p>
					<p> <code>    "leisure": [
							"park",
							"pitch",
							"playground",
							"fitness_centre",
							"fitness_station",
							"sports_centre",
							"sports_hall",
							"swimming_area",
							"swimming_pool",
							"sauna"
							]</code></p>
					<p> <code>    "tourism": [
							"museum",
							"gallery",
							"picnic_site"
							]</code></p>
			
			<h4>Flickr images</h4>					
			<p>Flickr is an image and video hosting service with a large community of users. In 2021 the platform has more than 100 million registered accounts and over 60 million monthly users. Up to 25 million photos are uploaded daily. Analysing these photos and especially their locations reveals interesting insights about the dynamics of an urban area. Flickr data has been used in a multitude of scientific studies, for example to detect areas of activity, to study spatiotemporal urban patterns, and to highlight urban hotspots especially in the context of travel and tourism</p>
			<p>The Flickr import automatically downloads all image locations from the last 5 years. With the current setup this part of the analysis is the longest and takes ~30 minutes per city region.</p>

			<h4>GTFS transit stops</h4>					
			<p>GTFS is a common format, originally developed by Google, for public transportation schedules and associated geographic information. Cities and public transportation agencies share their schedule information most commonly in the GTFS format. </p>
			<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs">Read more about GTFS data.</a></p>
				<h5>Where to find GTFS data</h5>
				<p>Other data sources are downloaded automatically by the service, but as a single endpoint to all GTFS feeds in the world does not exist, the user must enter manually the GTFS URL to the user interface when running the analysis. The URL should be ending with a <code>.zip</code>. So for example for Helsinki region the valid URL is http://dev.hsl.fi/gtfs/hsl.zip.  </p>	
				<p>A good source to search for GTFS feeds is <a href="https://openmobilitydata.org/feeds"> openmobilitydata.org</a>, where you can search by city/region name. For some countries individual city feeds are non-existent, but in these cases you can use the national feed (e.g. <a href="https://gtfs.de/en/feeds/de_nv/"> Germany</a> and <a href="https://nordicopenmobilitydata.eu/data/"> Sweden</a>). </p>

			<h4>OpenStreetMap walking times</h4>					
			<p>Whereas accessibility with public transport gives an idea of longer distances, walkability helps in understanding the attractiveness of a place on a more detailed scale.  At this scale distances are short, so walking becomes an important method of transportation. To model this aspect of accessibility, the services analyzes the walkable street networks of the cities by calculating walking times from every location in the street network to certain points of interest (POIs).</p>
			<p><a href="https://www.gispo.fi/en/blog/analysing-urban-walkability-using-openstreetmap-and-python/">Read more about the walkability analysis.</a></p>

			<h4>Ookla internet device numbers</h4>					
			<p>Ookla offers worldwide datasets of Internet speeds as measured by their broadband speed test service. The datasets cover the entire globe in a sub-kilometer resolution grid, and they are therefore an excellent independent measure of broadband speeds and user numbers across the globe.</p>
			<p><a href="https://github.com/teamookla/ookla-open-data">Read more about the Ookla data.</a></p>
			
			<h4>Kontur population density</h4>					
			<p>For this analysis the demographic dataset of choice was the Kontur population grid. It is an openly available and global population data set consisting of multiple different components: A satellite-imagery-based global human settlement layer, Facebookâ€™s population data, Copernicus land cover, OpenStreetMap data and Microsoft building footprints. By combining these data sets the Kontur population grid not only achieves global coverage, but also a high degree of interoperability as the methodology is standardized across the globe. For these reasons the data set was chosen for the analysis - it provides a scalable approach to analysing the population of any location anywhere in the world.</p>
			<p>Population data is built from H3 hexagons with population counts at 400m resolution.</p>
